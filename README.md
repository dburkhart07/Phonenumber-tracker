# Phonenumber-tracker
Takes in a user phonenumber and gives the state (works internationally too) that it is originally from. 
This app can take in any phone number. It uses the phonenumbers library from python, as well as geocoder to get the locations that these numbers are from. In certain cases, the tracker can also give the city/town if it is a number connected to a house. 
Although it does not work correctly, the commented out code is the process of trying to get the app to find the exact geographical location of the phone, in latitude and longitude coordinates. If anyone can figure out how to get that to work, please let me know.
